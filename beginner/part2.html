<body><h1>Linux Transition Guide Part 2: Installing Linux</h1>
<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>Now for the hardest part (but still pretty easy if you are patient): actually getting a system up and running. You will need a few things for this part, so get up and get them before you start.</p>
<h2>What this part will cover</h2>
<ul>
<li>Getting a Linux ISO</li>
<li>Installing Linux on your system</li>
</ul>
<h2>What you will need</h2>
<ul>
<li>A computer to install Linux on (this guide is for x86_64 devices)</li>
<li>A USB drive (4 GB or bigger, 8 GB reccomended)</li>
<li>An internet connection</li>
</ul>
<h2>Getting the ISO</h2>
<p>The ISO file is what we are going to be booting the target computer on to get into the live environment and install Linux. Now you have to make a descision. I will give you 2 distros to choose between, and the differences between them. Based on those differences, you are going to choose which distro you are going to use.</p>
<h3>Fedora</h3>
<ul>
<li>Is always up to date</li>
<li>Flatpak-first (Flatpaks are packages that work across any distro, and are often managed through a nice, understandable GUI)</li>
<li>The package manager, DNF, is readable and friendly</li>
<li>SELinux protects you from breaking stuff</li>
<li>The installer is simple and straightforward</li>
</ul>
<p>Perfect for:
- People coming from a different operating system
- People who want to learn Linux without being overwhelmed</p>
<h3>Debian</h3>
<ul>
<li>The package manager, APT, is simple and predictable</li>
<li>Structure is clean and logical</li>
<li>You learn the difference between stable/testing/unstable</li>
<li>You learn how to fix things when software is older</li>
</ul>
<p>Perfect for:
- People who want to manage everything themselves
- People who want to deeply understand Linux while still having simple tools to do so
- People who want a very stable, long-term system</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Fedora is a very "welcome to Linux" experience, while Debian is a "teaching you to be a sysadmin" experience. Debian will give you a few "there is no reason that this should be broken" moments if you aren't careful, but it does give you a lot of learning experience in return, and once you get it working, it will most likely keep on working if you don't touch it.</p>
<p>This guide was originally written to be used with Linux Mint, but I have gone back on that after realizing that Mint is a very "temporary" distro that you will immediately want to switch off of once you try something else. However, if you <em>really</em> want to see the guide with Mint, you can go <a href="part2_mint.html">here.</a></p>
<p>And now this is the part where the Fedora and Debian paths will split. You can go to the <a href="part2_fedora.html">Fedora</a> or <a href="part2_debian.html">Debian</a> page to continue.</p></body>
