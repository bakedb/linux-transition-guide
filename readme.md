# Linux Transition Guide
This repository includes:

## part{x}.md
Markdown files that contain the actual content of the guide.

## sources.md
A list of sources used (besides my prior knowledge), along with some useful complementary resources.

## to_html.py
Converts the markdown files to html. Requires the markdown library; install with `pip install markdown`.
